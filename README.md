# Hi there, I'm Hugo Roxo! 👋

### 🧬 Biomedical Engineer turned Software Developer
**Focused on AI Agents, Python & Web Solutions**

Welcome to my profile! I’m a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering transitioning into **Software Engineering** at **42 Porto**. I love the thrill of building things that *actually* work. I thrive in hackathons, love solving complex problems, and right now, I'm deep-diving into **Generative AI** and **Web Development** to create smarter solutions.
